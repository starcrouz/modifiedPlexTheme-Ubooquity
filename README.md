# modifiedPlexTheme-Ubooquity

This theme has been made for [Ubooquity](https://vaemendis.net/ubooquity/), the comics and books server. 

It is just a modified version of [the Plex theme](https://github.com/FinalAngel/plextheme) with 2 added fonctionnalities, no real design evolutions.

The first evolution has been made by [nullredirect](https://github.com/nullredirect/modifiedPlexTheme-Ubooquity) and shows **which books you are reading** these days with a green label "reading".

The second evolution is made by me and **hide duplicates** in your comics collection, giving priority to CBR and CBZ over PDF. The only file touched is on the root of the theme : it is "themeScript.js".

Enjoy !

## Sample screens
